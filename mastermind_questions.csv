What are the three levels of software design?,"Architectural design: The highest abstract version of the system. It identifies the software as a system with many components interacting with each other. At this level, the designers get the idea of proposed solution domain.
    
    High level design: The highlevel design breaks the ‘single entitymultiple component’ concept of architectural design into lessabstracted view of subsystems and modules and depicts their interaction with each other. Highlevel design focuses on how the system along with all of its components can be implemented in forms of modules. It recognises modular structure of each subsystem and their relation and interaction among each other.
    
    Detailed design: Detailed design deals with the implementation part of what is seen as a system and its subsystems in the previous two designs. It is more detailed towards modules and their implementations. It defines logical structure of each module and their interfaces to communicate with other modules.",software engineering
What is modularisation?,"A technique to divide a software system into multiple discrete and independent modules, which are expected to be capable of carrying out task(s) independently. Designers tend to design modules such that they can be executed and/or compiled separately and independently.",software engineering
What is concurrency?,"Back in time, all softwares were meant to be executed sequentially. By sequential execution we mean that the coded instruction will be executed one after another implying only one portion of program being activated at any given time. Say, a software has multiple modules, then only one of all the modules can be found active at any time of execution.
    In software design, concurrency is implemented by splitting the software into multiple
    independent units of execution, like modules and executing them in parallel. In other words,
    concurrency provides capability to the software to execute more than one part of code in
    parallel to each other.
    It is necessary for the programmers and designers to recognize those modules, which can be
    made parallel execution.",software engineering
What is cohesion?,"A measure that defines the degree of intradependability within elements of a

What is refinement?,"The process of breaking a parent class into multiple subclasses to capture some difference between objects in the class.
    
    The struggle is knowing how to split a parent class into multiple subclasses. For example, even if a program cares a bout certain differences between objects, that doesn’t mean those differences would make a good hierarchy. For example, customers at Cazoo care about Make and Model but this would be a horribly huge inheritance hierarchy.
    
    Differences between objects can be handled as properties rather than subclassing.
    
    A good way to split is based on behaviour. For example, say the Car class had an Accelerate method. This method might be different for manual cars vs automatic cars, so that could potentially be a good way to split the Car class  into Manual and Automatic subclasses.",software engineering
What is generalisation?,"It’s the opposite of refinement. You start with a several classes and create a parent for them to represent common features. For example, if creating a drawing tool, you can group all shapes that you can draw under a Drawable parent class.",software engineering
What is object composition?,"Another way to reuse code that isn’t inheritance. A technique that uses existing classes to create more complex classes.
    
    For example, say you define a Person class. You want to make a Company class. You can give the Company class a new property of type Person called ContactPerson. Now the Company class gets the benefit of the code defined by the Person class without the illogic and possible confusion of inheriting from Person.",software engineering

    pick particularly difficult test cases. Unfortunately it has the disadvantage that it takes a long time to write these tests and they need to be constantly updated.",software engineering
What is a smoke test?,"Preliminary testing to reveal simple failures severe enough to, for example, reject a prospective software release. Smoke tests are a subset of test cases that cover the most important functionality of a component or system, used to aid assessment of whether main functions of the software appear to work correctly.

How is the statistical significance of an insight assessed?,"Hypothesis testing is used to find out the statistical significance of the insight. To elaborate, the null hypothesis and the alternate hypothesis are stated, and the p value is calculated. After calculating the p value, the null hypothesis is assumed true, and the values are determined. To fine tune the result, the alpha value, which denotes the significance, is tweaked. If the p value turns out to be less than the alpha, then the null hypothesis is rejected. This ensures that the result obtained is statistically significant.",statistics

Can you explain how logistic regression works? Why is it called regression despite being a classifier?,"Logistic regression is called regression because the underlying technique is similar, but instead of fitting a straight line you are fitting a sigmoid (logit) function.

For instance, I often give films a 5/5 rating but someone might give their favourite film a 4/5 rating. I only rate films which I like, others might rate films that they dislike and give them a 0/5 rating. Pearson correlation is invariant to scaling.",machine learning

    Specificity or true negative rate is like Recall but every P becomes an N!
    
    Specificity: TN/TN + FP
    
    Specificity:
    
    Accuracy is easy to remember as all correct predictions divided by all predictions
    
    TP + TN / Number of predictions",machine learning
Give an example of when you are in a precision mindset?,"For example, book recommendation system. If you are using a precision mindset you are asking the model “Cut out loads of books, but what you return for me, let that be good!”

How would you decide whether to release a model?,"To decide whether to release the model, you can use a null hypothesis of “don’t launch it” and see if there is enough evidence to convince you otherwise.",machine learning
What is a p value?,A p value is the probability of obtaining a sample at least as extreme as the one we just observed in a world where the null hypothesis is true.,machine learning
What should you do if the model doesn’t pass your criteria at the testing phase?,"If at the testing phase, your model doesn’t pass the criteria set, then kill the model!!",machine learning
How should you retrain your model?,"Retraining of the model should be done in the background as more data is collected on users.
    
    The frequency at which you retrain the model should correspond to whether or not the data is constantly changing. Eg in the case of spam detection, models should be trained fairly frequently. In the case of language translation, language doesn’t change very quickly so you don’t need to retrain a model very frequently.",machine learning
What is training serving skew?,"Training serving skew is when the real world is different to the world of your training, validation and test data. Think Covid pandemic.

    A good example would be DynamoDB, or MongoDB.",software engineering
What are the differences between document and relational databases?,"A document database can be another name for a NoSQL database.
    
    They don’t require the careful planning of a SQL database but are more limited in their use. They store data in collections consisting of documents (something like a JSON). You can picture the document database like a filing cabinet and the collections as folders. The folders/collections will tell you what type of document is inside them but you can’t access the information inside those documents until you pull them out of the folder.
    
    The pros:
    
    More flexibility as you don’t have to define schemas and you don’t have to plan out your data into tables.
    
    The cons:
    
    Slower and you are limited in size. The way you query data is slower than if you used a SQL database, you have to pull out objects from the database into your application.
    
    Useful for dealing with lots of unorganised data, however if your data is more structured and your application needs to access specific information and how it’s related to other data points then a relational database is a better fit.",software engineering

What is event driven architecture?,"An event driven architecture uses events to trigger and communicate between decoupled services and is common in modern applications built with microservices.
    
    They have three key components: event producers, event router, and event consumers.
    
    Pros:
    
    1. Scale and fail independently: By decoupling your services, they are only aware of the event router (eg. EventBridge)
    2. Develop with agility: You don’t need to write custom code to route events, the event router will automatically filter and push events to consumers of events.
    3. Easier to audit: You can use event routers as a centralised location to audit your application and define policies.
    4. Cut costs: Event driven architecture is push based, so everything happens on demand as the event presents itself in the router. You’re not constantly checking for events.",software engineering

    Dagit is the front end tool for Dagster. Helps map ETL pipelines in a nice GUI.
    
    You can visualise all the steps in your pipelines as “nodes” in a graph called “solids”. A composite is a collection of solids.
    
    When you execute a node, you can see logs and it all looks very pretty.
    
    They aim to catch errors earlier on in the process
    
    You can execute steps independently locally.
    
    The developer can write solids that express pure business logic, separate from concerns that are specific to the execution environment.
    
    You can easily develop and test locally, which in turn learns to dramatically shorter feedback loops and large improvements in speed.

What is a Spark cluster?,"A Spark cluster is a combination of a Driver Program, Cluster Manager, and Worker Nodes that work together to complete tasks.",software engineering
How does Spark run applications with the help of its architecture?,"Spark applications run as independent processes that are coordinated by the SparkSession object in the driver program. The resource manager or cluster manager assigns tasks to the worker nodes with one task per partition. Iterative algorithms apply operations repeatedly to the data so they can benefit from caching datasets across iterations. A task applies its unit of work to the dataset in its partition and outputs a new partition dataset. Finally, the results are sent back to the driver application or can be saved to the disk",software engineering
What is the significance of Resilient Distributed Datasets in Spark?,"Resilient Distributed Datasets are the [fundamental data structure](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/data structure tutorial/what is data structure)

What is a lazy evaluation in Spark?,"When Spark operates on any dataset, it remembers the instructions. When a transformation such as a map() is called on an RDD, the operation is not performed instantly. Transformations in Spark are not evaluated until you perform an action, which aids in optimizing the overall data processing workflow, known as lazy evaluation.",software engineering
What is shuffling in Spark and when does it occur?,"Shuffling is the process of redistributing data across partitions that may lead to data movement across the executors. The shuffle operation is implemented differently in Spark compared to Hadoop.
    
    Shuffling has 2 important compression parameters:
    
    spark.shuffle.compress: checks whether the engine would compress shuffle outputs or not 
    spark.shuffle.spill.compress: decides whether to compress intermediate shuffle spill files or not
    
    It occurs while joining two tables or while performing byKey operations such as GroupByKey or ReduceByKey",software engineering

What are Python namespaces? How are they used?,"A namespace in Python ensures that object names in a program are unique and can be used without any conflict. Python implements these namespaces as dictionaries with 'name as key' mapped to a corresponding 'object as value'. This allows for multiple namespaces to use the same name and map it to a separate object. A few examples of namespaces are as follows:
    
    1. **Local Namespace** includes local names inside a function. the namespace is temporarily created for a function call and gets cleared when the function returns.
    2. **Global Namespace** includes names from various imported packages/ modules that are being used in the current project. This namespace is created when the package is imported in the script and lasts until the execution of the script.

How do you copy an object in Python? What’s the difference between a deep and a shallow copy?,"In Python, the assignment statement (`=` operator) does not copy objects. Instead, it creates a binding between the existing object and the target variable name. To create copies of an object in Python, we need to use the **copy** module. Moreover, there are two ways of creating copies for the given object using the **copy** module  
    
    1. A **shallow copy** means constructing a new collection object and then populating it with references to the child objects found in the original. In essence, a shallow copy is only *one level deep*. The copying process does not [recurse](https://realpython.com/python thinking recursively/) and therefore won’t create copies of the child objects themselves.
    2. A **deep copy** makes the copying process [recursive](https://realpython.com/python recursion/). It means first constructing a new collection object and then recursively populating it with copies of the child objects found in the original. Copying an object this way walks the whole object tree to create a fully independent clone of the original object and all of its children.
    
    ```python
    from copy import copy, deepcopy
    list_1 = [1, 2, [3, 5], 4]
    ## shallow copy
    list_2 = copy(list_1) 
    list_2[3] = 7

    list_2    # output => [1, 2, [3, 5, 6], 7]
    list_1    # output => [1, 2, [3, 5, 6], 4]
    ## deep copy
    list_3 = deepcopy(list_1)

What is pickling and unpickling in Python?,"Pickling basically lets you take Python objects and store them in memory
    
    **Pickling:**
    
    1. Pickling is the name of the serialization process in Python. Any object in Python can be serialized into a byte stream and dumped as a file in the memory. The process of pickling is compact but pickle objects can be compressed further. Moreover, pickle keeps track of the objects it has serialized and the serialization is portable across versions.
    2. The function used for the above process is `pickle.dump()`.
    
    **Unpickling:**
    
    3. Unpickling is the complete inverse of pickling. It deserializes the byte stream to recreate the objects stored in the file and loads the object to memory.
    4. The function used for the above process is `pickle.load()`.",software engineering
What are generators in Python?,"Generators are functions that return an iterable collection of items, one at a time, in a set manner. Generators, in general, are used to create iterators with a different approach. They employ the use of

    **dir()** function tries to return a valid list of attributes and methods of the object it is called upon. It behaves differently with different objects, as it aims to produce the most relevant data, rather than the complete information.
    
    1. For Modules/Library objects, it returns a list of all attributes, contained in that module.
    2. For Class Objects, it returns a list of all valid attributes and base attributes.
    3. With no arguments passed, it returns a list of attributes in the current scope.",software engineering
What is the difference between .py and .pyc files?,"    1. .py files contain the source code of a program. Whereas, .pyc file contains the bytecode of your program. We get bytecode after compilation of .py file (source code). .pyc files are not created for all the files that you run. It is only created for the files that you import.
    2.  Before executing a python program python interpreter checks for the compiled files. If the file is present, the virtual machine executes it. If not found, it checks for .py file. If found, compiles it to .pyc file and then python virtual machine executes it.
    3. Having .pyc file saves you the compilation time.",software engineering
How is Python interpreted?,"    1. Python as a language is not interpreted or compiled. Interpreted or compiled is the property of the implementation. Python is a bytecode(set of interpreter readable instructions) interpreted generally.
    2. Source code is a file with .py extension.
    3. Python compiles the source code to a set of instructions for a virtual machine. The Python interpreter is an implementation of that virtual machine. This intermediate format is called “bytecode”.
    4. .py source code is first compiled to give .pyc which is bytecode. This bytecode can be then interpreted by the official CPython or JIT(Just in Time compiler) compiled by PyPy.",software engineering

What is the difference between composition and inheritance and why would you favour composition over inheritance in Python?,"Inheritance is a “is a” relationship. Composition is a “has a” relationship.
    
    For example inheritance is when you create a subclass or a child class from a parent class.
    
    For example, Composition can be when you give a class an attribute that is a datatype from another class, or some of the methods of another class. You basically give it data from another class into your new class, but you are not inheriting.",software engineering
What is an abstract class in Python?,"A class is called an Abstract class if it contains one or more abstract methods. An abstract method is a method that is declared, but contains no implementation.

How are numpy arrays advantageous over Python lists?,"     1. The list data structure of python is very highly efficient and is capable of performing various functions. But, they have severe limitations when it comes to the computation of vectorized operations which deals with element wise multiplication and addition. The python lists also require the information regarding the type of every element which results in overhead as type dispatching code gets executes every time any operation is performed on any element. This is where the NumPy arrays come into the picture as all the limitations of python lists are handled in NumPy arrays.
    
    2. Additionally, as the size of the NumPy arrays increases, NumPy becomes around 30x times faster than the Python List. This is because the Numpy arrays are densely packed in the memory due to their homogenous nature. This ensures the memory free up is also faster.",software engineering

What is a transformer?,"A transformer is a deep learning model architecture introduced in the paper ""Attention Is All You Need"" by Vaswani et al. (2017). It is primarily used for natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, text generation, and language understanding. Unlike traditional recurrent or convolutional neural networks, transformers rely on a self-attention mechanism to capture relationships between different elements of an input sequence.",machine learning
What does GPT stand for?,"GPT stands for ""Generative Pre-trained Transformer."" It is a specific implementation of the transformer architecture that has been widely used for various natural language processing tasks. The GPT models are trained in an unsupervised manner on large amounts of text data and can generate coherent and contextually relevant text.",machine learning
What is an encoder in a transformer?,"In a transformer, the encoder is a component responsible for processing the input sequence. It consists of a stack of identical layers, each of which has two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise feed-forward network. The encoder processes the input tokens and produces a sequence of contextualized representations for each token.",machine learning
What is a decoder in a transformer?,"The decoder is another component of the transformer architecture. It is similar to the encoder but also includes an additional multi-head attention layer that attends over the encoder's output. The decoder is used for generating the output sequence autoregressively, token by token, based on the encoded input sequence and previously generated tokens.",machine learning
What is a token in a transformer?,"In the context of transformers, a token represents the smallest individual unit of input in a sequence. It can be a word, a subword, or even a character, depending on the level of tokenization used. The transformer processes these tokens and assigns each of them a corresponding embedding, which is then used as input for the subsequent layers.",machine learning
What is self-attention in a transformer?,"Self-attention, also known as scaled dot-product attention, is a mechanism used in transformers to capture dependencies between different positions within the same sequence. It allows each position to attend to other positions and learn the importance or relevance of those positions. Self-attention is computed by calculating attention scores between query vectors and key vectors, which are derived from the input sequence.",machine learning
What are query vectors in a transformer?,"In a transformer, query vectors are intermediate representations used in the self-attention mechanism. They are derived from the input sequence and serve as the source of information for attending over other positions in the sequence. Query vectors are compared with key vectors to compute the attention scores.",machine learning
What are key vectors in a transformer?,Key vectors are intermediate representations derived from the input sequence in a transformer's self-attention mechanism. They are used in conjunction with query vectors to compute the attention scores. Key vectors capture information about the different positions in the sequence and help determine the importance of each position for a given query.,machine learning
What is the attention score in a transformer?,"The attention score in a transformer represents the relevance or importance of a specific position in the input sequence for a given query. It is computed by taking the dot product of the query vector and the corresponding key vector, scaled by a factor to control the magnitude. The attention scores",machine learning
What is multi-head attention in a transformer?,"Multi-head attention is an extension of the basic self-attention mechanism in transformers. It allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously and capture various types of relationships. In multi-head attention, the query, key, and value vectors are projected multiple times into different subspaces, and self-attention is performed independently in each subspace. The outputs of these attention heads are then concatenated and linearly transformed to obtain the final representation. Multi-head attention enables the model to capture different types of information and enhance its representation learning capabilities.",machine learning
What is positional encoding?,"Positional encoding is a technique used in transformers to incorporate the order or position of tokens in the input sequence. Since transformers do not inherently encode sequential information, positional encoding is added to provide the model with positional information. It is typically achieved by adding fixed sinusoidal functions of different frequencies and phases to the input embeddings. The positional encodings are learned during training and allow the model to differentiate between tokens based on their relative positions in the sequence. Positional encoding helps the model understand the sequential structure of the input data.",machine learning
What is a feed forward network?,"A feed forward network, also known as a point-wise feed-forward network, is a component present in each layer of the transformer model. It consists of two linear transformations with a non-linear activation function (such as ReLU) applied in between. The feed forward network takes the output from the self-attention mechanism, processes it element-wise, and produces a new representation for each token in the sequence. It introduces non-linearity and enables the model to capture complex interactions and dependencies between tokens. The feed forward network plays a crucial role in the overall transformation and information flow within the transformer.",machine learning
What is an attention head?,"An attention head refers to an individual self-attention mechanism in a multi-head attention layer of a transformer. In multi-head attention, the input embeddings are projected multiple times to different subspaces, and each subspace performs a separate self-attention computation. Each self-attention computation, or attention head, attends to different aspects of the input sequence and captures distinct relationships. By having multiple attention heads, the transformer can capture different patterns and dependencies, allowing for more robust and comprehensive representation learning.",machine learning

What are the first aid steps for chemical burns?,"There are a wide variety of chemicals and substances which can cause chemical burns. These can range from household chemicals such as bleach, cleaning products, pesticides to strong industrial chemicals used in the workplace. Chemical burns can be incredibly serious as the chemical will keep damaging the skin and tissue until it is removed.

**Step 1:** Check for any dangers to yourself. The chemicals that caused the casualty’s injuries could also pose a danger to you. Try to establish what caused the burn and how safe the chemicals are. If you are in an enclosed area, move the casualty outside or open windows to prevent the build up of fumes. Wear disposable gloves.

**Step 2:** Cool the burn with copious running water for at least **15 – 20 minutes**. Ensure that you do not come into contact with the water used to cool the burn as it may contain the harmful chemical.

**Step 3:** If any clothing has come into contact with the chemical, it should be removed providing it isn’t sticking to the burn. Try to identify the chemical involved and its container.

**Step 4:** Cover the burn with a sterile, non-fluffy first aid dressing. If no dressing is available, then improvise. Good items to use include cling-film and plastic bags.

If you suspect someone is suffering from low blood sugar, you should attempt to raise the blood sugar by offering something sweet such as a sugar cube / sugary drink / sugary snack. The casualty may be carrying snacks for such a situation.

If the casualty has a reduced level of consciousness, or does not respond to the treatment above, you should call an emergency ambulance.

If someone is unconscious, don’t try to put anything in their mouth (such as a sugar cube) to attempt to raise their blood sugar as this could be a choking risk.",first aid
What causes seizures?,"There are numerous reasons why someone may have a seizure (convulsion / fit). One of the most well known causes is a medical condition called Epilepsy where the electrical activity in the brain is disturbed. However there can be a variety of other causes including:

- Head injuries
- Drugs / Alcohol
- Poisoning
- Low blood sugar (Hypoglycaemia)
- In infants, high temperatures.

Seizures are often characterised by a loss of consciousness followed by uncontrolled muscle contractions. They can be quite frightening for those who haven’t witnessed a seizure before. Sometimes a seizure is preceded by a warning sign known as an “aura”.",first aid
What are the first aid steps for seizures?,"**Step 1:** Remove any objects from around the casualty (chairs, tables etc.) to prevent them injuring themselves. Make the area as safe as practically possible

**Step  2:** Protect the casualty’s head by padding around it and underneath the neck. Don’t place bulky padding underneath the casualty’s head as this could tilt their head forwards and close their airway.

**Step 3:** Try and establish a cause for the seizure. Are they a known to suffer from Epilepsy? Do they have Diabetes? Have they had an injury recently? Look for medical alert bracelets on the casualty’s wrists/ankles/neck which may contain details of any medical conditions.

**Step 4:** Call an ambulance unless the casualty is known to have seizures regularly and doesn’t normally go to hospital.

**Step 5:** Note how long the seizure lasts for, and whether there are any gaps.

**Step 6:** When the seizure stops, open the casualty’s airway by tilting their head backwards and check for normal breathing for up to 10 seconds. If they are breathing then roll them onto their side to protect their airway. If they are not breathing then commence cardiopulmonary resuscitation.",first aid
What is asthma?,"The body has a system of tubes (known as airways) to carry air from our mouth/nose to our lungs. The largest of these is our trachea (known as windpipe). This then splits into two bronchi which then split into a network of tiny bronchioles. This network of bronchioles delivers air to the tiny sacs where gas exchange takes place (known as alveoli).

Asthma is an inflammatory condition of the smallest airways – the bronchioles. These tiny tubes can become inflamed and secrete excessive amounts of mucous causing severe difficulty in breathing. This is known as an asthma attack. The cause of asthma is thought to be a combination of environmental and genetic factors.

An asthma attack is normally triggered by something, whether it be an allergen (e.g: pollen, dust, vehicle emissions, soot etc.) or an environmental condition such as cold air. Normally, an asthma attack is characterised by the following symptoms:

- A wheezing sounds when breathing
- Difficulty in breathing
- Unable to complete a full sentence
- Hyperventilation
- Anxiety and panic

What are the first aid steps for an asthma attack?,"**Step 1:** Sit the casualty down in the position they find most comfortable for their breathing.

**Step 2:** Find their medication, which is normally an inhaler (possibly with a spacer device) containing a drug such as Salbutamol.

**Step 3:** Assist the casualty to use their medication. They should know how many doses to take and how to use the inhaler.

**Step 4:** Provide reassurance and help calm the person’s breathing if they are hyperventilating.",first aid
What is a fracture?,"A fracture is the same as a broken bone and the two terms can be used interchangeably. A fracture can occur for many reasons, often due to trauma or excess force being placed on the bone. Some rare medical conditions can also lead to an increased risk of fractures.

Generally, you can have several different types of fractures in first aid:

> **Open fracture:** This is where the bone has pierced the skin and caused an open wound which may bleeding. There is a high risk of infection with these injuries

> **Closed fracture:** A fracture which has not caused an open wound

> **Complicated fracture:** A fracture which damages nerves and blood vessels, this can cause permanent nerve damage or loss of blood supply to a limb.

> **‘Greenstick‘ fracture:** Common in children as their bone’s are more “bendy”, therefore their bones are less likely to fully break. Instead the bone splinters.",first aid
What are the signs and symptoms of a fracture?,"If someone has a fracture / broken bone, you may see any of the following:

- Pain
- Loss of movement of the limb / area
- Angulation
- Swelling & bruising (this may not occur immediately)
- Tenderness over the area

Fractures may not always be incredibly painful, the pain may take a few hours to develop. Sometimes a fracture can be mistaken for a sprain or a strain.",first aid
What are the first aid steps for fractures?,"If you suspect someone has a fracture, then you should follow the first aid steps below:

**1)** Keep the area as still as possible, ask the person not to move it

**2)** Expose the site of injury to check for any bleeding or open wounds. If there is a bone through the skin then do **not** move it, instead cover with a sterile dressing if available. If the wound is bleeding then apply gentle pressure around the wound.

**3)** Pad around the injured area with blankets / clothing. If the person has hurt their arm then ask them to hold it in the most comfortable position possible

**4)** Quickly arrange transport to the nearest hospital.",first aid
What are the first aid steps for cuts and grazes?,"**Step 1**: Stop any bleeding. You can elevate the wound or apply direct pressure using a sterile gauze swab/pad.

**Step 2**: Clean the wound using running water or antiseptic wipes. Dry with a sterile gauze swab/dressing.

**Step 3**: Ensure the area around the wound is clean (no dirt, grit etc.)

**Step 4**: Cover with a sterile dressing/plaster. Remember some people might be allergic to regular plasters!",first aid
What are the first aid steps for a dog bite?,"You can treat a dog bite by following the simple first aid advice below.

**Step 1:** Using clean water (with soap/an antiseptic product if possible) wash the wound thoroughly. Make sure to clean the area around the wound as well.

**Step 2:** Cover the wound with a sterile wound dressing. If the bleeding is severe, apply direct pressure and call for an ambulance.

**Step 3:** If there is a risk of infection (ie, you are in a rabies risk area) or the wound appear serious, then seek medical advice immediately. The casualty may require an injection to protect them from the rabies virus.",first aid
How do you treat a nosebleed?,"**Step 1:** Ask the person to tilt their head forwards and pinch the soft part of their nose for ten minutes. Encourage them not to pick at their nose or sniff. Ask them to breathe through their mouth.

**Step 2:**

After 10 minutes release the pressure and see if the bleeding has stopped. If it hasn’t, reapply the pressure. You can also try placing something cool on the nose (ice pack etc.) to constrict the blood vessels.

**Step 3:** Once the bleeding has stopped, clean up any blood from around the face/mouth. Tell the person not to sneeze/pick at their nose/sniff for several hours as this could cause the bleeding to start again.",first aid
How do you treat a wasp sting?,"The first aid for a wasp sting is incredibly simple

**1)** Watch for any signs of  a serious allergic reaction known as ‘anaphylaxis’ – things to watch out for include difficulty in breathing, severe swelling and redness over the whole body (anaphylaxis was discussed in the medical conditions module of this course). If you suspect they are having an allergic reaction then call an ambulance immediately.

**2)** If the ‘stinger’ is still visible in the skin then try to remove it. It’s best to try to brush the stinger away using a credit card / fingernail rather than using tweezers.

**3)** Cool the area using an ice pack / bag of frozen peas / cold compress. This will help reduce the swelling and the pain.",first aid
